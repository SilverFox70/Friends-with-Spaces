                    <p class="large text-muted">A lot of time and effort has gone into building this web app, and by the time it has fully launched, a ton more will have gone into it. For the time being there are no plans to monetize this. This is <em>not</em> the next AirBnB or Uber for space. We are just trying to connect people in our community together to take advantage of all of the beautiful space that sits empty and unused so much of the time. This is my idea of the <strong>sharing</strong> economy: actually sharing resources. Of course, I think it is right and fair that "owners" would want to charge or barter for use of their space. Why not?</p>
                    <h4>Donate Something!</h4>
                    <p class="large text-muted">Donating a small amount of cash through PayPal helps. It takes time and effort to build this, to maintain it, and it will cost money out of pocket to set it up on a nice domain. Anything helps. (paypal to wfbrinkert@gmail.com)</p>
                    <p class="large text-muted">If you have skills in HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, or Ruby-on-Rails and would like to become a part of this project, let me know! I could always use a hand.</p>

Every space listed will have a name, like "Cozy Castle" or "Radical Ranch", a short description, and a location (<em>NOT an address!</em>), such as "North Berkeley".  You can also provide some pictures so that folks have a sense of what your space is like. In the <strong>Alpha</strong> version, things will be really straight forward. You might want to ask a fee or donation for the use of your space.  That's up to you - we are just here to connect people. Finally, you'll fill out some "Available Times" that you would be willing to let a friend use your space. </p>
                            <p>Anyone who comes to the site will be able to browse around and see the listings. If they are interested in using your space, we will put the two of you in contact with each so that you can work out the details.

                            <p><strong>When are you really launching?</strong></p>
                            <p>We plan to be live for our Alpha tests at the very end of May. This means that things will be up and running, but we acknowledge it will be buggy and sometimes ugly. But that's what an alpha release is like. We will use the irst several weeks to gather data on how folks are using the site, and also to listen to feedback.  Expect a full bete release later this summer.</p>
                            <p><strong>Isn't this just like those other "BnB" type sites?</strong></p>
                            <p>No, not really. We are just iming to connect people together. We are not involved with any kind of "rental". We don't make any money off of folks sharing their spaces.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p><strong>Can I share my space with people I don't know?</strong></p>
                            <p>You could, but we don't recommend it. You should really only share your space with people that you feel you can trust.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p><strong>What about liabilities, like theft or personal injury?</strong></p>
                            <p>We don't make any money off of this. We don't sell anything. Think of this as a forum where you can find private space if you need it, and can share your private space with others. Because of this, we are not liable for anything that happens as a result of your using this site to engage in sharing spaces.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p><strong>I rent my apartment, is it legal for me to use this site?</strong></p>
                            <p>We can't answer that question because we don't know.  We have nothing to do with the details of your sharing your space with friends. Therefore, we are not liable if you do something - anything - that is in violation of lease or residency terms for your space.</p>
                            <hr>
                            <p><strong>How is this safe?  Can't criminals use this to go window shopping?</strong></p>
                            <p>Is it safe?  That depends on whom you are sharing your space with, and that's not our call, so choose wisely.  That's why we call this "Friends with Spaces", not "Strangers Looking To Score" or something like that. Make deals with your friends and people you can trust.  As for "window shopping", we do not collect information on your address, so even if someone hacks us, they can never find what isn't here - namely, the address where you live. </p>
